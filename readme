Imagine a version of tetris that you wouldn't want to play, but make it worse. 
That's the goal here. 

I wrote this as a learning project, and as it turns out I had a lot to learn. The goal was to 
figure out how to make this work entirely on my own, without copying solutions from anywhere else, 
or even so much as a general guide to follow. I feel that my overall comfort level with js has increased
to the point that I can now start building on my current skill level. After this I plan to learn about RESTful APIs
and gain experience and knowledge working with all the relevent elements of the MERN stack. Once I've built a few 
practice projects we'll see what happens. 

Saving because I want something to look back on. 

(thanks for reading my blog, lol)
